# SkyGlide - A Simple Flight Game

## About The Game

**SkyGlide** is a lightweight, minimalist 3D flying game that opens in a new tab. Inspired by the smooth, satisfying flight of Minecraft's Elytra, Glide launches instantly and drops you into an endless, procedurally generated world.

The goal is simple: fly as far as you can, dodging obstacles and honing your reflexes. With its fast loading time and replayable nature, it's designed to be the perfect micro-game for when you need a quick break.

### Core Features

*   **Third-Person Flight**: Experience smooth, satisfying flight physics from a third-person perspective.
*   **Endless World**: Navigate through an infinite, procedurally generated landscape of obstacles. Every run is unique.
*   **Lightweight & Fast**: Built with performance in mind using Three.js and Vite, ensuring a high FPS experience that doesn't bog down your browser.
